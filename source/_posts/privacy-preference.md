**Google**

1. Personalize your Google experience

   - Web & App Activity
   - Location History
   - Device Information
   - Voice & Audio Activity
   - YouTube Search History
   - YouTube Watch History

2. Help people connect with you

   - Help people who have your number connect with you across Google services. Learn more
   - Also help them find your name, photo, and other information that you've made visible on Google. Learn more

3. Control what others see about you

   - Shared endorsements

4. Make ads more relevant to you

   You can change the types of ads you see from Google when you adjust your interests, age and gender or opt-out of ads based on your interests. Please note that you will still see ads after opting out — they’ll just be less relevant.
